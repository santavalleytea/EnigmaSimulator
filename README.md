# Enigma Machine Simulator

This project is a C++ implementation of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used primarily by Nazi Germany during World War II to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. The simulator allows users to input plaintext messages and outputs the corresponding encrypted ciphertext. The Enigma machine consists of rotors, a reflector, and a plugboard, all of which are modeled in this implementation.

## Features

- **Rotor Configuration**: Customize the wiring and notch positions of the rotors.
- **Reflector**: Implement the reflector with customizable wiring.
- **Plugboard**: Configure plugboard settings to swap pairs of letters.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using the same settings.
